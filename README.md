# Early-Stage-Detection-of-Chronic-Kidney-Disease-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

This is a machine learning project that aims to classify patients as having chronic kidney disease (CKD) or not based on various medical attributes. The dataset used for this project is kidney_disease.csv.

**Dependencies**
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Keras (with TensorFlow backend)

**Project Overview**
**Data Preprocessing:**
Load the dataset from kidney_disease.csv.
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**
Visualize the dataset using various plots and charts.
Explore the correlations between different predictors.

**Model Training and Evaluation:**
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train and evaluate multiple classifiers, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Logistic Regression.
Compute accuracy, precision, F1-score, confusion matrix, and log loss for each classifier.
Train and evaluate an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Keras.

**Decision Tree Visualization:**
Visualize the decision tree model using graphviz.

**Results Analysis:**
Compare the performance of different classifiers based on accuracy and log loss.
Visualize the accuracy and log loss of each classifier using bar plots.

**Results**
The performance of each classifier and the ANN is summarized in the following bar plots:

Classifier Accuracy: Accuracy Bar Plot
Classifier Log Loss: Log Loss Bar Plot

**Conclusion**
Based on the results, the ANN achieved an accuracy of 65% and a log loss of X. The decision tree model also provided valuable insights into the classification process.
